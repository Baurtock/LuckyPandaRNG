# LuckyPanda RNG

## What is LuckyPanda?

LuckyPanda is an API designed to provide random number generation (RNG) services. It is intended for applications that require high-quality randomness, such as games, simulations, or statistical sampling. The project also includes a suite of tools to analyze and test the quality of the RNG.

## Automatic Semantic Versioning

This project uses an automated versioning system based on commit message formatting:

### Commit Prefixes and Versioning

- **`fix:`** → Increments **PATCH** version (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)
- **`feature:`** or **`feat:`** → Increments **MINOR** version (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)  
- **`major:`** → Increments **MAJOR** version (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)
- **Any other prefix** → Increments **PATCH** version by default

### Commit Examples

```bash
git commit -m "fix: correct parameter validation bug"

git commit -m "feature: add new statistics endpoint"
git commit -m "feat: implement redis cache"

git commit -m "major: change API response format"
```

### Generated Docker Tags

For each release, these tags are automatically generated:

- `ghcr.io/your-username/luckypanda-rng:latest`
- `ghcr.io/your-username/luckypanda-rng:1.2.3` (semantic version)
- `ghcr.io/your-username/luckypanda-rng:v1.2.3` (with v prefix)
- `ghcr.io/your-username/luckypanda-rng:sha-abc1234` (commit SHA)

### Deployment

The system automatically deploys 10 replicas to Kubernetes when pushing to the `master` branch.

## How to run the API

1. **Using Docker Compose**  
   To start the API with Docker Compose, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This will build and launch the API service.

2. **Directly with Docker**  
   Alternatively, you can use the provided `Dockerfile`:
   ```
   docker build -t luckypanda .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 luckypanda
   ```

3. **Running Locally**  
   If you have Go installed, you can run the API directly:
   ```
   cd src
   go run main.go
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## RNG Tools Suite

The `tools/` directory contains scripts and resources to test and analyze the RNG:

- **analize.sh**: Bash script to analyze the output of the RNG and generate statistical data.
- **makeApiCalls.sh**: Script to make multiple API calls and collect random numbers for analysis.
- **samples.csv**: Example output file containing random numbers generated by the API.
- **histogram.png**: A histogram image visualizing the distribution of the generated random numbers.

### How to Use the Tools

1. Run `makeApiCalls.sh` to collect random numbers from the API and save them to `samples.csv`:
   ```
   ./tools/makeApiCalls.sh
   ```

2. Run `analize.sh` to analyze the collected samples and generate a histogram:
   ```
   ./tools/analize.sh
   ```

3. Check the `histogram.png` file to visually inspect the distribution.

## RNG Concepts Explained

- **Random Number Generator (RNG)**: A system or algorithm that produces a sequence of numbers that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by random chance.
- **Uniform Distribution**: The ideal output of an RNG, where each possible value has an equal probability of being chosen.
- **Statistical Analysis**: The process of evaluating the randomness and distribution of the generated numbers to ensure quality and lack of bias.
